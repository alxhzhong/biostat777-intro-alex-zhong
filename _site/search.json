    "text": "Motivation and questions\nIn a 2021 article, the New York Times reported an increase in UFO sightings over the pandemic, especially in New York state. Several possible causes were identified, including more time spent home, lower light pollution, and urban residents moving to rural areas, especially during the start of the pandemic in early 2020.\nI found this intriguing, and wanted to replicate these findings with more recent data to see whether UFO sightings continue to be elevated. I also wanted to explore whether increased UFO sightings were reported across the United States (or were a localized New York event).\nMy questions for this analysis are:\n\nHave UFO sightings increased in 2020-2021, and has the increase continued into later years?\nHow is the change in UFO sightings spatially distributed?"
