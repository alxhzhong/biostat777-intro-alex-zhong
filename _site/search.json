    "text": "Motivation and questions\nIn a 2021 article, Sarah Maslin Nir at the New York Times reported an increase in UFO sightings over the pandemic, especially in New York state. Several possible causes were identified, including more time spent home, lower light pollution, and urban residents moving to rural areas, especially during the start of the pandemic in early 20201.\nI found this intriguing, and wanted to replicate these findings with more recent data to see whether UFO sightings continue to be elevated. I also wanted to explore whether increased UFO sightings were reported across the United States (or were a localized New York event).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is an assignment for my statistical computing course. I am not a subject matter expert, and all analyses are for demonstration purposes only.\n\n\nMy questions for this analysis are:\n\nHave UFO sightings increased in 2020-2021, and has the increase continued into later years?\nHow is the change in UFO sightings spatially distributed?"

    "text": "Changes in sightings during pandemic\nNow that we have our final dataset, let’s look at the change in sightings over the pandemic.\nSince the NYTimes article cited people staying at home as one of the reasons that UFO sightings increased, I’ve chosen to highlight the period of decreased mobility in the US as described by Elarde et al., who estimated that time spent in public places sharply decreased in March 2020 and returned to pre-pandemic levels by June 20202.\nFirst, I plotted UFO sighting count by day:\n\n\nCode\nufo_sightings %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    count = n()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = count)) +\n    annotate(\"rect\", \n             xmin = ymd(\"2020-03-01\"), \n             xmax = ymd(\"2020-06-01\"), \n             ymin = -Inf, \n             ymax = Inf,\n             fill = \"orange\",\n             alpha = 0.5) +\n    annotate(\"text\",\n             x = ymd(\"2020-06-15\"), \n             y = 65,\n             hjust = 0,\n             label = \"Decreased mobility \\nduring pandemic \\nMar-May, 2020\",\n             color = \"darkorange\",\n             size = 10/.pt) +\n    geom_point(size = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    scale_x_date(breaks = \"1 year\", labels = scales::date_format(\"%Y\")) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Daily UFO sighting counts in the US (2018-2023)\",\n      subtitle = \"Sightings increased over 2019 and peaked in early 2020 just before pandemic;\\nElevated sighting counts were not sustained past 2020\",\n      x = \"Date\",\n      y = \"Daily UFO sighting count\",\n      caption = \"Data from National UFO Reporting Center\"\n    )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above, it seems that daily UFO sighting counts started to increase around 2019, then peaked right before the start of the pandemic in the US before falling over the rest of 2020. There is a slight increase in daily sightings towards the end of 2022, but levels are fairly similar to pre-2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we see a rise in UFO sightings in 2019?\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing data from the National UFO Reporting Center, Cockrell et al. set out to analyze whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in UFO sighting reports.\nThey found a similar rise in UFO sighting reports starting in 2019, and posited that this was due to the then concurrent launches of the Starlink satellites. Cockrell et al. argue that these satellites provided new visual phenomena that were unique enough to report as UFOs, and showed that Starlink launches were quickly followed by new reports of UFOs described similarly to the satellites3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Zachary Hagerman/NBC Connecticut (Feb 13, 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sighting counts by day are quite noisy, so I also plotted UFO sighting count by month:\n\n\nCode\n# by month:\nufo_sightings %&gt;% \n  # taking floor to extract month\n  mutate(month = floor_date(date, \"months\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(month) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    count = n()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  # add var to highlight pandemic months\n  mutate(period = factor(ifelse(month %within% interval(ymd(\"2020-03-01\"), ymd(\"2020-05-01\")), \"highlight\", \"normal\"))) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month, y = count, fill = period)) +\n    # shift by half month so bars are centered on middle of the month\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_nudge(x = 15)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"grey50\")) +\n    annotate(\"text\",\n             x = ymd(\"2020-06-05\"), \n             y = 600,\n             hjust = 0,\n             label = \"Decreased mobility \\nduring pandemic \\nMar-May, 2020\",\n             color = \"darkorange\",\n             size = 10/.pt) +\n    theme_classic() +\n    scale_x_date(breaks = \"1 year\", labels = scales::date_format(\"%Y\")) +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Monthly UFO sighting counts in the US (2018-2023)\",\n      subtitle = \"Monthly sightings sharply increased during start of pandemic (Mar/Apr 2020)\",\n      x = \"Date\",\n      y = \"Monthly UFO sighting count\",\n      caption = \"Data from National UFO Reporting Center\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly sightings follow a similar trend to daily sightings: an increase starting in early 2020, peaking around the start of the pandemic in the US, then a decrease by the end of 2020. There is also a similar small increase in sightings around late 2022.\nIt also seems that indeed, the first two months of restricted movement in the pandemic (March and April, 2020) have much higher UFO sighting counts compared to the prior two months (January and February, 2020). We’ll use that 4-month time span of Jan-Apr 2020 to look at the geographic distribution of the change in sightings."

    "text": "Summary\nThis analysis explored the change in UFO sightings over time and over space in the United States, with particular attention to changes over the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March through May, 2020). We found an increase in monthly sightings during months with restricted mobility (March/Apr 2020) compared to just before stay-at-home orders were issued (Jan/Feb 2020). However, analysis of daily sightings revealed a concurrent trend of increasing reports over 2019 into 2020, which may impact any inferences about the cause of the increase in sightings. Looking at the change in sightings by state, we observe the greatest increase in the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) and Upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan), and a decrease in states mostly in the South (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas).\nOverall, results from this analysis generally agree with the New York Times article–we do observe an increase in UFO sighting reports. However, the cause(s) of this increase may be more complicated, with potential regional/local and non-pandemic (e.g. Starlink satellite) factors at play."
