## Motivation and questions

In a 2021 [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/nyregion/ufo-sightings-recent.html){.external target="_blank"}, Sarah Maslin Nir at the New York Times reported an increase in UFO sightings over the pandemic, especially in New York state. Several possible causes were identified, including more time spent home, lower light pollution, and urban residents moving to rural areas, especially during the start of the pandemic in early 2020 [@nir2021].

I found this intriguing, and wanted to replicate these findings with more recent data to see whether UFO sightings continue to be elevated. I also wanted to explore whether increased UFO sightings were reported across the United States (or were a localized New York event).

My questions for this analysis are:

-   Have UFO sightings increased in 2020-2021, and has the increase continued into later years?
-   How is the change in UFO sightings spatially distributed?

## Intended audience

The intended audience is the general public, especially UFO enthusiasts.

## Data source and dictionary

The datasets used in this analysis come from the 06/20/2023 Tidy Tuesday [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-20){.external target="_blank"}. Original data comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=shape){.external target="_blank"}, which has maintained a public database of globally crowdsourced eyewitness reports of UFO sightings since 1994.

I will be using the `ufo_sightings` and `places` datasets, whose data dictionaries can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-20#data-dictionary){.external target="_blank"}.

## Data import and cleaning

First, to import the datasets:

```{r}
#| warning: false

# load needed packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(here)
library(usmap)
library(sp)
library(BAMMtools)
library(scales)

# load datasets
if (!file.exists(here("data", "ufo_sightings.RDS"))) {
    ufo_sightings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/ufo_sightings.csv')
    places <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-06-20/places.csv')

    # save the files to RDS objects
    saveRDS(ufo_sightings, file = here("data", "ufo_sightings.RDS"))
    saveRDS(places, file = here("data", "places.RDS"))
}

raw_ufo_sightings <- readRDS(here("data", "ufo_sightings.RDS"))
raw_places <- readRDS(here("data", "places.RDS"))

glimpse(raw_ufo_sightings)
glimpse(raw_places)
```

Then, to clean and wrangle the `places` dataset. These are fairly clean & tidy datasets already, so there isn't much to do:

```{r}
places <- raw_places %>% 
  select(city, state, country_code, latitude, longitude) %>% 
  filter(country_code == "US")
```

Note that the place names can vary in capitalization (e.g. Yukon, OK on the right table), so I'll standardize and remove duplicates:

```{r}
#| column: margin
# ex. Yukon, OK has three entries:
places %>% 
  filter(str_detect(city, regex("yukon", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
# standardize capitalizations
places <- places %>% 
  mutate(city = str_to_title(city)) %>% 
  distinct()
```

Next, to wrangle the `ufo_sightings` dataset, I'll remove the time information and keep observations from 2018 on (to give us ~2 years before and after the pandemic). Then, I'll add in latitude/longitude data from `places`.

```{r}
ufo_sightings <- raw_ufo_sightings %>% 
  select(reported_date_time_utc, city, state, country_code) %>%
  mutate(
    date = as_date(reported_date_time_utc),
    city = str_to_title(city)
  ) %>% 
  filter(country_code == "US", date > "2018-01-01") %>% 
  # add lat/long from places
  left_join(places, by = join_by(city, state, country_code)) %>% 
  select(-reported_date_time_utc) %>% 
  relocate(date)

# look at our dataset
head(ufo_sightings)
```

## Changes in sightings during pandemic

Now that we have our final dataset, let's look at the change in sightings over the pandemic.

Since the NYTimes article cited people staying at home as one of the reasons that UFO sightings increased, I've chosen to highlight the period of decreased mobility in the US as described by Elarde et al., who estimated that time spent in public places sharply decreased in March 2020 and returned to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 [@elarde2021].

First, I plotted UFO sighting count by day:

```{r}
ufo_sightings %>%
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = count)) +
    annotate("rect", 
             xmin = ymd("2020-03-01"), 
             xmax = ymd("2020-06-01"), 
             ymin = -Inf, 
             ymax = Inf,
             fill = "orange",
             alpha = 0.5) +
    annotate("text",
             x = ymd("2020-06-15"), 
             y = 65,
             hjust = 0,
             label = "Decreased mobility \nduring pandemic \nMar-May, 2020",
             color = "darkorange",
             size = 10/.pt) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth() +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_x_date(breaks = "1 year", labels = scales::date_format("%Y")) +
    labs(
      title = "Daily UFO sighting counts in the US (2018-2023)",
      subtitle = "Sightings increased over 2019 and peaked in early 2020 just before pandemic;\nElevated sighting counts were not sustained past 2020",
      x = "Date",
      y = "Daily UFO sighting count",
      caption = "Data from National UFO Reporting Center"
    )
```

From the plot above, it seems that daily UFO sighting counts started to increase around 2019, then peaked right before the start of the pandemic in the US before falling over the rest of 2020. There is a slight increase in daily sightings towards the end of 2022, but levels are fairly similar to pre-2019.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Why do we see a rise in UFO sightings in 2019?

Using data from the National UFO Reporting Center, Cockrell et al. set out to analyze whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in UFO sighting reports.

They found a similar rise in UFO sighting reports starting in 2019, and posited that this was due to the then concurrent launches of the Starlink satellites. Cockrell et al. argue that these satellites provided new visual phenomena that were unique enough to report as UFOs, and showed that Starlink launches were quickly followed by new reports of UFOs described similarly to the satellites [@Cockrell2023-COCSFA].

The sighting counts by day are quite noisy, so I also plotted UFO sighting count by month:

```{r}
# by month:
ufo_sightings %>% 
  # taking floor to extract month
  mutate(month = floor_date(date, "months")) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(
    count = n()
  ) %>% 
  # add var to highlight pandemic months
  mutate(period = factor(ifelse(month %within% interval(ymd("2020-03-01"), ymd("2020-05-01")), "highlight", "normal"))) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month, y = count, fill = period)) +
    # shift by half month so bars are centered on middle of the month
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_nudge(x = 15)) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "grey50")) +
    annotate("text",
             x = ymd("2020-06-05"), 
             y = 600,
             hjust = 0,
             label = "Decreased mobility \nduring pandemic \nMar-May, 2020",
             color = "darkorange",
             size = 10/.pt) +
    theme_classic() +
    scale_x_date(breaks = "1 year", labels = scales::date_format("%Y")) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(
      title = "Monthly UFO sighting counts in the US (2018-2023)",
      subtitle = "Monthly sightings sharply increased during start of pandemic (Mar/Apr 2020)",
      x = "Date",
      y = "Monthly UFO sighting count",
      caption = "Data from National UFO Reporting Center"
    )
    
```

Monthly sightings follow a similar trend to daily sightings: an increase starting in early 2020, peaking around the start of the pandemic in the US, then a decrease by the end of 2020. There is also a similar small increase in sightings around late 2022.

It also seems that indeed, the first two months of restricted movement in the pandemic (March and April, 2020) have much higher UFO sighting counts compared to the prior two months (January and February, 2020). We'll use that 4-month time span of Jan-Apr 2020 to look at the geographic distribution of the change in sightings.

## Geographic distribution of change in sightings

Next, let's look at the geographic distribution of changes in sightings.

First, I'll filter the data to include only reports from Jan-Apr 2020:

```{r}
pandemic_sightings<- ufo_sightings %>% 
  filter(date %within% interval(ymd("2020-01-01"), ymd("2020-04-30"))) %>% 
  mutate(
    time_period = case_when(date < "2020-03-01" ~ "before", .default = "after") %>% 
                  factor(levels = c("before", "after"))
    )

pandemic_sightings %>% 
  group_by(time_period) %>% 
  count()
```

We have 705 sightings in Jan-Feb 2020, and 1204 sightings in Mar-Apr 2020. Let's see where those sightings were reported in the US:

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| warning: false
transformed_sightings <- usmap_transform(pandemic_sightings, input_names = c("longitude", "latitude")) %>% 
  mutate(time_period = fct_recode(time_period, `Jan-Feb 2020` = "before", `Mar-Apr 2020` = "after"))

plot_usmap() +
  geom_point(transformed_sightings, mapping = aes(x, y, color = time_period), size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~time_period) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(
    title = "UFO sightings before and during pandemic stay-at-home orders in US",
    subtitle = "The West Coast and Midwest experienced the greatest increase in UFO sightings",
    caption = "Data from National UFO Reporting Center"
  )

```

While it's a bit hard to tell from the maps above, it looks like there was an increase in sightings in the Midwest and West Coast regions of the US. Let's look at the change in sightings by state:

```{r}
diff_sightings <- pandemic_sightings %>% 
  group_by(state, time_period) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = time_period, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(
    abs_diff = after - before,
    perc_diff = abs_diff / before,
    fips = fips(state)
  ) %>% 
  select(state, fips, abs_diff, perc_diff)
```

```{r}
# Using Jenks natural breaks to change color scale
# I feel this makes the scale more readable, especially since there are a few states with very high values 
abs_scale <- getJenksBreaks(diff_sightings$abs_diff, 7) %>% rescale(to = c(0,1))
perc_scale <- getJenksBreaks(diff_sightings$perc_diff, 7) %>% rescale(to = c(0,1))

plot_usmap(data = diff_sightings, values = "abs_diff") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "BrBG", direction = 1, values = abs_scale) +
  labs(
    title = "Absolute change in UFO sightings before vs. during pandemic by US state",
    subtitle = "The West Coast and upper Midwest had the greatest increase in UFO sightings,\nwhile Florida and Texas saw the greatest decrease in sightings",
    fill = "Change in \nsightings",
    caption = "Data from National UFO Reporting Center"
  )

plot_usmap(data = diff_sightings, values = "perc_diff") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "PiYG", direction = 1, values = perc_scale, labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  labs(
    title = "Percent change in UFO sightings before vs. during pandemic by US state",
    subtitle = "The upper Midwest had the greatest % increase in UFO sightings,\nwhile Mississippi and Louisiana saw the greatest % decrease in sightings",
    fill = "% change \nin sightings",
    caption = "Data from National UFO Reporting Center"
  )

```

State-level change maps support our initial observation that sightings increased the most in the Midwest and West Coast. However, we can also see that some states experienced a decrease in sightings, with many in the South.

## Summary

This analysis explored the change in UFO sightings over time and over space in the United States, with particular attention to changes over the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March through May, 2020). We found an increase in monthly sightings during months with restricted mobility (March/Apr 2020) compared to just before stay-at-home orders were issued (Jan/Feb 2020). However, analysis of daily sightings revealed a concurrent trend of increasing reports over 2019 into 2020, which may impact any inferences about the cause of the increase in sightings. Looking at the change in sightings by state, we observe the greatest increase in the West Coast (California, Oregon, Washington) and Upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan), and a decrease in states mostly in the South (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas). 

Overall, results from this analysis generally agree with the New York Times article--we do observe an increase in UFO sighting reports. However, the cause(s) of this increase may be more complicated, with potential regional/local and non-pandemic (e.g. Starlink satellite) factors at play.
