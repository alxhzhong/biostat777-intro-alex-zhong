### Hello!

Welcome to my website, and thanks for stopping by!

I am a 1st year ScM student studying [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

My research interests include causal inference, infectious diseases, and environmental/spatial statistics, though I am interested in exploring new areas in biostatistics.

To learn more about me, explore the [About](about.qmd) page. For an 🛸out of this world🛸 analysis, check out the [Example analysis](example_analysis.qmd) page.
